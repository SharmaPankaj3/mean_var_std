# Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator

This project provides Python scripts to calculate the **mean**, **variance**, and **standard deviation** of datasets. It includes functionality for both calculation and testing.

## Files

- `Mean_Var_Sd.py`: Main script containing functions to compute mean, variance, and standard deviation.
- `test.py`: Test script to verify the correctness of the calculations.

## How to Use

1. Run `Mean_Var_Sd.py` to perform statistical calculations on your data.
2. Use `test.py` to run test cases and validate the functions.
